Description: This package provides a streamlined approach to creating
    consistently structured packages (i.e. it is a package for making packages).
    The structure is particularly designed to be convenient for "learning"
    packages: packages that are intended to distribute course materials that are
    a mixture of pre-written functions, data, exercise scripts, and interactive
    tutorials.
    This package implements a framing of materials in terms of themed
    "topics", which functions, data, scripts, and tutorials are in turn
    organized by within the package (in addition to general, cross-topic
    objects).
    `useclinic` composes and wraps functions from the `usethis`
    library to accomplish setting up new learning packages, as well as
    performing basic refactoring and extension tasks associated with the
    conceptualization of the materials.
